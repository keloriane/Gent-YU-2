> Here you can find an overview of the BeCode program. (work in progress)

---
## Main goals of the Gent-Yu:

For the first time i will have a fulltime group. I really want to bring my motivation to the next Level.
My goal for the begining of the training is the create alongside with Thijs a nice and warm atmosphere and enforce the group philosophy. I have learn a lot of lessons from my other groups and my mistakes i can easely say that i have the skills to take care of them.
I will start every week by a standup meeting with group where they will put for each day their goals.
Every day i will make them remind of there goals and ask them how far are they in their goals.
Avoid competitivity and keep every one on the same level. ask the more advanced junior of the group to help the ones that are a little bit far ahead.
For each learning challenge, there will be a consolidation challenge to make sure everyone is on track.
Debriefing 2 to 3 times per week or more if needed.
Have a one on one meeting with each juniors. Since we will be 2 coaches. It will be easy for us to have a good followup.


Along with Thijs, make sure that every Juniors follow the rules and are responsible for the well beeing of their camrades.
